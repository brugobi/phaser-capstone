## Game Design Document

This game is inspired by the TV Show serie *The walking dead* and here you are the hero and you fight to stay alive from the attacks of zombies and bad people, for that you have the ability to shoot them, but you have to be careful because you can die if they shoot you first or touch you.

### Templates


To create the game I used two different templates. The phaser 3 one that you can find here created by [Richard Davey](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template) and one created by Willian Clarkson that helped me with some functionalities. Ckeck out his [website](https://williamclarkson.net) ! Big cheers to the amazing creators.
