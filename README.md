# THE WALKERS

> This is a desktop shoot game implemented it using Phaser. For developing the game, I used JavaScript and Phaser 3 along with Express to host it on gh-pages. I implemented an API provided by [Microverse Program](https://www.microverse.org/) to host the scoring database so that the highest scores will always be available for new users to try to beat! The API implementation required the use of promises and Async functions. I also used Classes and Modules to integrate everything in an industry-standard code style while implementing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS best practices.

## Game Design Document

This game is inspired by the TV Show serie *The walking dead* and here you are the hero and you fight to stay alive from the attacks of zombies and bad people, for that you have the ability to shoot them, but you have to be careful because you can die if they shoot you first or touch you. You also have just 5 minutes to beat the highest scores.

### Templates


To create the game I used two different templates. The phaser 3 one that you can find here created by [Richard Davey](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template) and one created by Willian Clarkson that helped me with some functionalities. Ckeck out his [website](https://williamclarkson.net) and support if possible! Big cheers to the amazing creators.
